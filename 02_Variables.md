## Variables

Variables are used to temporarily store data in memory for use in a program. You assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

### Naming Rules

* Use lowercase letters and underscores (`_`) for variable names (snake_case)
* Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, and cannot start with a number
* Avoid using Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.) as variable names

### Examples:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_logged_in = True
```

### Good Practices

* Choose descriptive names so your code is easier to read
* Stick to a consistent naming style throughout your code

> Remember: variable names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different)

### Tip:

You can reassign variables as needed:

```python
score = 10
score = score + 5  # Now score is 15
```
