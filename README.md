# 🐍 Python Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal Python study notes! This repository documents my journey as I learn Python from scratch and grow toward becoming an AI/ML developer.

These notes are based on hands-on practice, self-study, and real-time problem solving. They are written in my own words to reflect my understanding, logic, and thought process. The goal is to:

* 📚 Reinforce what I've learned
* 🛠️ Track my learning progress
* 🤝 Share my journey with others who are learning Python
* 💡 Help beginners by showing practical, beginner-friendly explanations

## 🗂 What's Inside

Each topic is organized into a separate Markdown file for clarity and easy reference:

* `01_arithmetic_operators.md`
* `02_variables.md`
* `03_data_types.md`
* ... (more to be added)

There’s also a **master summary file** that compiles all key concepts into one place for quick review.

## 🙌 Who This Is For

* Beginners looking to understand Python concepts through clean examples
* Anyone curious about how one self-taught learner breaks down programming
* Devs who enjoy seeing code through another person’s lens

## 📌 Why I Made This

I believe in **learning out loud**. Sharing my raw notes, even if imperfect, helps me stay accountable, and maybe even help others starting out in tech. This is also part of my portfolio as I transition into a tech role.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This folder of notes is constantly evolving. It's not perfect, and that's intentional. I’ll continue adding, improving, and restructuring content as I grow in my Python journey. If something looks unfinished, it probably is — and that’s okay. 😊
