# 🐍 Python Learning Notes

Welcome to my personal **Python learning notes** repository! 👨‍💻📓

This repo is my way of documenting what I'm learning as I work through Python, from the fundamentals to more advanced topics. All explanations are written in my own words, based on how I understand each concept.

Whether you're:

* a beginner starting out,
* someone who prefers "learning through another learner",
* or just curious to see how others explain and absorb Python, this repo is for you!

## 🌱 Work in Progress

These notes are **a continuous work in progress**, I add new sections as I go. They're not perfect, but they reflect my genuine learning journey and thought process.

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This
